- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am **Aniruddha Das Aurgha** , a beginner programmer from Bangladesh.
-  I read in class 9, and I like to do programming.
-  Aviation and its topics really attract me a lot.
-  Besides this, I am also quite interested in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, ICT and some other things.
-  I have first started my coding journey with Python, which was included in my school curriculum.
-  In recent times I have started learning about HTML, CSS and Javascript.
-  Wish me a good luck in my journey!
